KD - The customer service is absolutely terrible, seems to be located in India and no one knows what they are doing or even listens to what you are saying, they just answer robotically. I was given 7 different numbers all seem to go back to the same collections dept apart from one which was the IT helpdesk; was told their isnt a switchboard number and to personally visit the office. No one I spoke had even heard of a Treasury dept.
