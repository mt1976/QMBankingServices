Agricultural Bank of China (London)
London

The predecessor of Agricultural Bank of China is Agricultural Cooperative Bank established in 1951. Since the late 1970s, the Bank has evolved from a state-owned specialized bank to a wholly state-owned commercial bank and subsequently a state-controlled commercial bank. The Bank was restructured into a joint stock limited liability company in January 2009. The Bank was listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, respectively in July 2010, which marked the completion of our transformation into a public shareholding commercial bank.
