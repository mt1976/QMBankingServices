Since the late 1970s, the Bank has evolved from a state-owned specialized bank to a wholly state-owned commercial bank and subsequently a state-controlled commercial bank. The Bank was restructured into a joint stock limited liability company in January 2009. The Bank was listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, respectively in July 2010, which marked the completion of our transformation into a public shareholding commercial bank.
Being one of the major integrated financial service providers in China, the Bank is committed to catering to the needs of Sannong and capitalizing on the synergy between the Urban Areas and the County Areas. The Bank strives to expand into the international market and provides diversified services so as to become a first class modern commercial bank. Capitalizing on the comprehensive business portfolio, extensive distribution network and advanced IT platform, the Bank provides various corporate and retail banking products and services for a broad range of customers and carries out treasury operations for our own accounts or on behalf of customers. Our business scope includes, among others, investment banking, fund management, financial leasing and life insurance. At the end of 2012, the Bank had total assets of RMB13,244,342 million, deposits of RMB10,862,935 million and loans of RMB6,433,399 million. Our capital adequacy ratio and non-performing loan ratio were 12.61% and 1.33%, respectively. The Bank achieved a net profit of RMB145,131 million in 2012. 
The Bank had 23,472 domestic branch outlets, including the Head Office, the Business Department of the Head Office, three specialized institutions managed by the Head Office, 37 tier-1 branches (including branches directly managed by the Head Office), 348 tier-2 branches (including business departments of branches in provinces), 3,482 tier-1 sub-branches (including business departments in municipalities, business departments of branches directly managed by the Head Office and business departments of tier-2 branches), and 19,600 other establishments. Our overseas branch outlets consisted of four overseas branches and five overseas representative offices. Our major subsidiaries consisted of nine domestic subsidiaries and three overseas subsidiaries.
In 2012, the Bank ranked No. 84 in Fortune’s Global 500, and ranked No. 5 in The Banker’s “Top 1000 World Banks” list in terms of profit before tax for the year of 2011. In 2012, the Bank’s issuer credit ratings were assigned A/A-1 by Standard & Poor’s; the bank deposits ratings were assigned A1/P-1 by Moody’s Investors Service; and the long-/short-term foreign-currency issuer default ratings were assigned A/F1 by Fitch Ratings. The Bank’s outlook ratings assigned by the above credit rating agencies were “stable”."||||

Need to see where they are urgently! I have emailed gary

spoke to Gary, they have been using BM Plus for years and years only trade FX and have 3 dealers - he saysmaybe they could look but he has a lot going on and cb in 1 month and see if we can get a meet. MP plus is f and back office I think he could be persuaded.

I spoke to Gary who tells me that I should go through Ashley now and that they are investing mostly in infrastructure but they are going to stick with BM plus that they have had for 15 years. Ashley can identify if there is a gap for deal capture and it would be taken from a separate treasury budget to buy.

Nigel was keen to hear about Siena FO and our take on the market in London and what business pains we can offer banks the solutions for. Nigel has 140 banks in London as members of the AFB.  
We spoke about Eurobase and our developments and also our new hire and they were interested to meet  David and see if he might be suitable to speak at an AFB event or add any value you may wish too. I understand that the conferences and events  will cover a variety of topics and some not in our space but the audience is still very relevant and Nigel seems keen to invite his contacts to suggest topics so maybe we could influence a session? 
I think there would be mutual benefit to nurture this relationship. They have a good understanding of what we do and I hope they can point us in the right direction in London as to possible business leads. 
This week I have made the introduction for DW to meet with Nigel he made it clear that he is very interested in DW speaking at the next conference in May and provided us with sponsorship packages. The plan would be to suggest that DW speaks free of charge and VH is going to follow up with Nigel on who we can mutually benefit from this relationship. We need to ensure we get the best introduction to AFB members who are treasurers and dealing managers and I am sure we can generate PR out of the relationship. I need to respond to Nigel about his offer and suggest the next steps and ask him what he can do for us with his members."||||http://www.foreignbanks.org.uk/

Paul Whippy tells me that GIB are looking at Zenith for a securities module: Victoria,
Neither of the names you mentioned are familiar, the guys who came here were Edward Trahearn and Festus Mensah. Thanks for the details on the single dealer platform, I’ll take a look at it this week.

For GIB try Mark Arthur. He is a senior manager and most decisions go to him from Gino. The bank is also our Customer. tried mark arthur, no answer

Mark Arthur told me that they were testing a Temenos solution which is the interfaces to Reuters, no other functionality than that and he would not have me see them until that was done. He said there is a group project going on and he wants to keep moral up as they are testing it... and does not see the value in looking at something else. I fought him a bit about what we did for Zenith and how much more he could gain and that we have the interfaces and much more.... was not having it. Said no and I sent him an email to reinforce my point.

Spoke on 1/6 - they have T24 solution which they believe will do everything they want it too but they have not realised the capabilities yet, they just want what reuters offers which is to send all the info RT has through to T24 and they are still testing that and he has no need to look at our FO as he thinks T24 and RT interface combined will do the trick. I asked for his advice on banks in Ghana, he says that 80k to 100k a year is too expensive and the only top tier bank in Ghana who might be able to do that is the Central bank - Bank of Ghana who are a suspect already. He said a lot of the banks look"|Gino Brenzini|T24/FXCB||

They are keen to meet with CM and I tomorrow for more detail on our technology.

Very nice and we get on well. He said they use Midas equation and they have a strong relationship with them. He does not like the system though. They are doing trades manually and have no STP for reuters and bloomberg dealing. He asked me specifically if we do RTFX and connect via broadband which I said yes we do. They have no real time updating on positions either. One person does a trade while the other is checking the limit and there is no real time.  He says that they do have some limit checking but not very good. 
He thinks they will be forced to move of this and automate things better, he wants information and I will call him back.
